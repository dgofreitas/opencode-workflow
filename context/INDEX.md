# Context Index

> **Flat semantic index — single navigation entry point.**
> Format: `path | tags: ... | summary: one-line description`
>
> Read this file first. Then read only the leaf files matching the task.
> 5 buckets, flat: no subdirectory navigation files.

## 🧠 How agents use this index

1. **Read** `INDEX.md` (this file) — 1 read.
2. **Filter** entries by tags matching user intent.
3. **Rank** by priority tags: `critical` → `mandatory` → remaining.
4. **Return** up to 5 leaf files. If more match, report "N more available on demand".
5. **If a library/framework is mentioned and no entry matches** → recommend ExternalScout.

Do **not** navigate subdirectories. Do **not** open files not in this index. The index is the map.
