# /mode — Set SDLC Execution Mode

Deterministic override for the mode Master otherwise infers from trigger phrases (see `CLAUDE.md` → Execution Modes). Use this when the switch matters enough that you don't want to rely on phrase matching — e.g. before starting a batch run, or to drop back to manual mid-session.

## Action

This is a **Master-level action, not a subagent delegation** — run the bash commands directly in this context, no `Task()` call.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (case-insensitive):

- empty or `status` → `cat .claude/.exec-mode 2>/dev/null || echo "default (no override file)"`. Report the current mode. Do nothing else.
- `default` / `manual` → `rm -f .claude/.exec-mode`. Confirm: "Modo: default (todos os gates pedem aprovação)."
- `auto-gate` / `auto` / `auto-gates` → `echo "auto-gate" > .claude/.exec-mode`. Confirm: "Modo: auto-gate (GATE-PM/SA/AR/MR automáticos, GATE-NEXT ainda pergunta)."
- `batch-auto` / `batch` → `echo "batch-auto" > .claude/.exec-mode`. Confirm: "Modo: batch-auto (todos os gates automáticos, roda até esgotar a fila)." The queue itself (`.claude/.batch-queue.json`) is built by the normal Batch-Auto flow on the next delegation (story IDs from the prompt, or `ls docs/stories/STORY-*.md` minus already-merged stories) — this command only sets the mode flag, it does not start execution.
- anything else → ask the user to pick one of: default / auto-gate / batch-auto.

## Safety notes

- Switching mode mid-story does not interrupt an in-flight `tech-lead` skill invocation — it only changes gate behavior for turns after this command runs.
- Switching to `default` mid-batch (`rm .claude/.exec-mode`) does **not** clear `.claude/.batch-queue.json`. The queue file stays; a later `batch-auto` would resume it. To abandon the queue entirely, also run `rm -f .claude/.batch-queue.json`.
- This never bypasses Pre-Merge Verification (CLAUDE.md §6.1) — that check is independent of mode and always runs before GATE-MR.

## Output

One line confirming the new or current mode. No pipeline explanation.
